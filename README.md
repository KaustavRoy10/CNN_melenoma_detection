# CNN_melenoma_detection

>  AIM: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Hence, creating a solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Building a Convolutional Neural Network using keras library for image processing and create a model that classifies skin disease among 9 differnt classes. 
- The proposed solution has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. Automating the diagnosis process by leveraging deep learning techniques, the model aims to provide timely and reliable assistance to healthcare professionals, improving patient outcomes.
- The dataset is prepared by International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases that are sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets are divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant
